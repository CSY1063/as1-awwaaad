            <h2>Introduction</h2>
    
            <p>In this report, I will discuss the process of designing a portfolio with only HTML and CSS.<br> I will reflect on the challenges faced, the skills acquired and the lessons learned throughout the design process</p>
            <h2>Challenges</h2>
            <p> I did not have enough knowledge in the web development as I was unable to attend classes due to challenges with tuition fees. I faced challenges in understanding and implementing complex CSS layouts and techniques although I watched youtube videos so I can understande better. Ensuring the website was responsive and looked good on different screen sizes was a significant challenge.
                It required careful planning and testing to achieve a consistent layout across devices. Maintaining design consistency throughout the website, including typography, colors and spacing and it was challenging. It required attention to detail and frequent revisions to achieve a cohesive look and feel.
                The biggest issue I faced was trying to position the header on contact and project. In the CSS, on positioning, I used fixed instead of relative. So I got what
                after changing it to relative.
            </p>
            <h2>Design Process</h2>
            <p>I did not have any issues with the deisgn process as I am a UI Designer. The design process of creating my portfolio website involved several key stages:
                <li>Planning: I started by defining the purpose of the portfolio website and setting specific goals. I outlined the sections I wanted to include, such as Home, Contact, Projects and so on.</li>
                <li>Research and Inspiration: I conducted research on existing portfolio websites to gather inspiration for design layouts, color schemes and content organization. This helped me generate ideas for my own website.</li>
                <li>Wireframing and Prototyping: Before diving into coding, I created wireframes and prototypes to visualize the layout and structure of each webpage. This step helped me plan the placement of elements and the overall user flow.</li>
                <li>HTML Markup: With the wireframes as a guide, I began coding the HTML structure of the website. I focused on creating semantic markup and organizing content into meaningful sections and divs.</li>
            </p>
            <h2>Skills Acquired</h2>
            <p> Despite the challenges, the project helped me develop several valuable skills:
                <li>HTML and CSS Proficiency: Through hands-on practice, I improved my skills in HTML markup and CSS styling, gaining a better understanding of how to structure web pages and apply styles effectively. I now know how to use different HTML tags and styling methods.</li>
                <li>Responsive Design Techniques: I learned various techniques for creating responsive layouts, including media queries to ensure the website was accessible and functional across different devices. Although I still need to practice how to make my desgigns responsive on different resolutions.</li> 
                <li>Problem-Solving Skills: The project involved solving complex problems and overcoming technical challenges, which improved my problem-solving skills and critical thinking abilities.</li>
                <li>Attention to Detail: Paying attention to small details such as spacing, alignment and consistency was important for creating a polished and professional-looking website.</li>
            </p>
            
            <h2>Lessons</h2>
            <p>Doing this assignment opened my mind to alot of things about web designing as a novice and taught me several valuable lessons:
                <li>Continuous Learning: Web design and development are constantly evolving fields, requiring continuous learning and adaptation to stay updated with the latest trends and technologies.</li>
                <li>Simplicity is Key: Keeping the design simple and focused is essential for creating an effective portfolio website. Avoiding clutter and unnecessary elements helps in conveying key information more effectively.</li>
                <li>Feedback is Valuable: Seeking feedback from peers, mentors and users is crucial for improving the design and usability of the website. Constructive feedback helps in identifying areas for improvement and refining the design further.</li>
                <li>Persistence Pays Off: Overcoming challenges and learning from mistakes are essential parts of the design process. Persistence and dedication are key to achieving success in web design and development.</li>
            </p>

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>Designing a portfolio website as a student was a challenging yet rewarding experience. It allowed me to apply and enhance my HTML and CSS skills while learning valuable design principles and techniques.
